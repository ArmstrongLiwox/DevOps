### 1. what is the SDLC

According to wikipedia:

In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the 
application development life cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 
The SDLC concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, 
or a combination of both. 
There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

### 2. what is the LAMP stack

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is an acronym denoting one of the most common software stacks for many of the web's most popular applications. 
However, LAMP now refers to a generic software stack model and its components are largely interchangeable.
Each letter in the acronym stands for one of its four open-source building blocks:

>**Linux** for the operating system
>**Apache** HTTP Server
>**MySQL** for the relational database management system
>**PHP, Perl, or Python** programming language.

The components of the LAMP stack are present in the software repositories of most Linux distributions.
