According to wikipedia:

In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the 
application development life cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 
The SDLC concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, 
or a combination of both. 
There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.
