# LAMP STACK IMPLEMENTATION

## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (Lamp stack) in AWS

What is a technology stack?
A technology stack is a set of frameworks and tools used to develop a software product.

some examples are as follows:
1. **LAMP** (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python or Perl)
1. **LEMP** (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python or Perl)
1. **MERN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
1. **MEAN** (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS)

### 1. what is SDLC

According to wikipedia:

In systems engineering, information systems and software engineering, the systems development life cycle (SDLC), also referred to as the 
application development life cycle, is a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. 
The SDLC concept applies to a range of hardware and software configurations, as a system can be composed of hardware only, software only, 
or a combination of both. 
There are usually six stages in this cycle: requirement analysis, design, development and testing, implementation, documentation, and evaluation.

### 2. what is LAMP stack

LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is an acronym denoting one of the most common software stacks for many of the web's most popular applications. 
However, LAMP now refers to a generic software stack model and its components are largely interchangeable.
Each letter in the acronym stands for one of its four open-source building blocks:

>**Linux** for the operating system
>**Apache** HTTP Server
>**MySQL** for the relational database management system
>**PHP, Perl, or Python** programming language.

The components of the LAMP stack are present in the software repositories of most Linux distributions.

### 3. what is *chmod* and *chown* commands in Linux

### chmod

In Unix and Unix-like operating systems, **chmod** is the command and system call used to change the access permissions and the special mode flags ***(the setuid, setgid, and sticky flags)*** of file system objects (files and directories). 
Collectively these were originally called its modes, and the name chmod was chosen as an abbreviation of change mode.

### chown

The command **chown**, an abbreviation of change owner, is used on Unix and Unix-like operating systems to change 
the owner of file system files, directories. 
Unprivileged (regular) users who wish to change the group membership of a file that they own may use chgrp.
The ownership of any file in the system may only be altered by a super-user. A user cannot give away ownership of a file, even when the user owns it. 
Similarly, only a member of a group can change a file's group ID to that group.
The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities. The chown command has also been ported to the IBM i operating system.
